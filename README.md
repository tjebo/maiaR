microperimetR
=============

The goal of microperimetR is to make workflow with MAIA and Compass
easier. Importing from MAIA raw export files in a breeze. Creation of
simple summarising visual fields indices and creation of more complex
figures such as cumulative defect curves.

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to import from your raw
files:

``` r
# save the tgz files from MAIA into your R working directory 
# devtools::install_github(tjebo/microperimetR)
# library(microperimetR)
# read_maia()
```
