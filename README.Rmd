# maiaR

The goal of maiaR is to make workflow with MAIA easier. Importing from MAIA raw export files in a breeze. Creation of simple summarising visual fields indices and creation of more complex figures such as cumulative defect curves. 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to import from your raw files:

```{r example}
#save the tgz files from MAIA into your R working directory 
# library(maiaR)
# getMAIA()
```
